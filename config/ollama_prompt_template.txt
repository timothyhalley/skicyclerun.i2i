CRITICAL: You MUST output BOTH sections below. Missing either section means your response is INVALID.

TRAVEL BLOG: Your 3-5 sentence paragraph starts here immediately after the colon.

SUMMARY: Your one complete sentence starts here immediately after the colon.

EXAMPLE OF CORRECT FORMAT:
TRAVEL BLOG: The desert stretches endlessly under the blazing sun. A lone cactus stands sentinel. The air shimmers with heat.

SUMMARY: A stark desert landscape features a solitary saguaro cactus under intense sunlight.

DO NOT include placeholder text like "[paragraph]" or "[sentence]".
DO NOT explain your thinking.
DO NOT add extra lines or sections.
