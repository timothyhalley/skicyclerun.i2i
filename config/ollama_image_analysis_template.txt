ATMOSPHERE / TONE:

VISIBLE TEXT:
- Transcribe any text in the image (signs, plaques, inscriptions).
- If text is in a foreign language, provide translation.

LANDMARKS / LOCATION CONTEXT:
- Identify recognizable landmarks or geographic clues.
- Provide cultural or contextual significance if possible.

COMPOSITION / TECHNICAL NOTES:
- Comment on framing, perspective, lighting, or style.

SCENE CLASSIFICATION:
- Interior or Exterior?
- Scene type: urban/nature/historic/transit/beach/waterfront/mountain/other

LOCATION CONTEXT:

EXECUTION RULES:
- Output each section once, no repetition.
- Be concise and decisive.
- One shot only — no wandering or multiple takes.
