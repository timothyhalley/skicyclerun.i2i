START: Reset context. Do not carry over instructions from previous tasks. 
RESET CONTEXT: Only use the metadata provided below for this image.

MISSION: You are generating descriptive content based on an image and its metadata. 
Write in a smooth, factual narrative style. Do not use phrases such as 
"I am analyzing," "this photo shows," "appears to be," or "analysis." 
Do not hedge or speculate. Focus on confident, factual description.
Ground all conclusions in the provided GPS/location data. Do not speculate or reference external sources.

AUTHORITATIVE DATA (must be used exactly):
- GPS Coordinates: {photo_gps_lat}, {photo_gps_lon}
- Altitude: {photo_altitude} m
- Camera Heading: {photo_heading}° {photo_cardinal}
- Location (must match exactly): {photo_city}, {photo_state}, {photo_country}
- Road/Address: {photo_road_or_display_name}
- OSM: type {photo_osm_type}, category {photo_category}, place type {photo_type}
- Nearby POIs (trusted list): {nearby_pois}
- Provider: nominatim

GUARDRAILS:
- Location fidelity: Output location must equal {photo_city}, {photo_state}, {photo_country}. Do not substitute or infer another place.
- Evidence hierarchy: EXIF/Nominatim > visible text-in-image > general world knowledge.
- Conflict handling: If visible cues seem inconsistent with the location, note the conflict and uncertainty, but keep the location unchanged.
- **POI CONTEXT IS CRITICAL**: The nearby_pois field below contains descriptions, dates, heritage status, and historical context. YOU MUST USE THIS INFORMATION in your description and summation. Do not ignore it.
- **HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE**: If a POI has context data (description, built date, heritage, Wikipedia), incorporate ALL of it into your description. Explain when created, by whom, and cultural importance to {photo_city}.
- POI discipline: Only list POIs provided in {nearby_pois} or those clearly visible and consistent with GPS. Do not invent POIs.
- Watermark must include: {photo_city}, {photo_country}.
- No promotional adjectives. No mentions of "photo" or "image". No "taken at".
- If uncertain, use generic but accurate descriptors and mark uncertainty.

GROUNDING SECTION:
- Using {photo_gps_lat}, {photo_gps_lon} and the location metadata, summarize factual context about this place (terrain, land use, architectural/landscape types consistent with OSM).
- Provide a detailed paragraph (6–10 sentences) summarizing these grounded findings.
- Then list nearby POIs in bullet form. If none are certain, write "None identified."

INPUT SECTION:
- GPS: {photo_gps_lat}, {photo_gps_lon} at {photo_altitude} m | Heading: {photo_heading}° {photo_cardinal}
- Location: {photo_city}, {photo_state}, {photo_country}
- Road/Address: {photo_road_or_display_name}
- OSM: type {photo_osm_type}, category {photo_category}, place type {photo_type}

**NEARBY POIs WITH CONTEXT (USE THIS DATA):**
{nearby_pois}

REMINDER: The POI context above contains historical facts you MUST use in your description and summation.

TASKS:
1) Detailed description: Write 1–2 paragraphs in flowing prose, aligned with the location and OSM context. 
   **CRITICAL**: Check nearby_pois field for context data (descriptions, dates, heritage info). If present, you MUST incorporate this historical information.
   If the subject is a historic landmark, use the POI context to explain: who created it, when it was built/unveiled, its cultural significance to {photo_city}, and any unique features mentioned in the context.
   Mention landscape, architecture, or cultural features confidently and factually.

2) Summation: Condense into 2–3 sentences that clearly state the subject AND its historical significance using POI context data. 
   If POI context includes dates, designers, or cultural importance, include these facts in your summation.
   Note uncertainties only if unavoidable, but do not speculate.

3) Watermark summation (≤12 words): Incorporate highlights from the description. 
   Include kanji characters with [English translation].

4) Watermark location: Format as [subject/landmark], [city + state if USA / province if Canada / country if elsewhere].
